	- Putting most of my waking hours into leveling up voicebots at [skit.ai](https://skit.ai) - it's where my mental energy lives right now.
	- Cricket weekends are non-negotiable - both for sanity and fitness (focused on bowling).
	- Desperately trying to wrestle my sleep and eating patterns into something resembling a routine.
	- Immersed in reading [Anxious People by Fredrik Backman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127718-anxious-people).
	- Swimming is calling my name again. Time to answer.
	- Recently went to "Lollapalooza 2025" for Green Day (felt like a closure) and experienced my first-ever live musicial "Phantom of the Opera" in Mumbai (10/10). #Recommends
