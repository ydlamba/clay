## March 2025
	- Putting most of my waking hours into leveling up voicebots at [skit.ai](https://skit.ai) - it's where my mental energy lives right now.
	- Cricket weekends are non-negotiable - both for sanity and fitness *(focused on bowling)*.
	- Desperately trying to wrestle my sleep and eating patterns into something resembling a routine.
	- Immersed in reading [Anxious People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127718-anxious-people) by Fredrik Backman.
	- Swimming is calling my name again. Time to answer.
	- Recently went to Lollapalooza for "Green Day" *(felt like a closure)* and experienced my first-ever live musicial "Phantom of the Opera" in Mumbai *(solid 10/10 recommended)*.
